# Election Alternate Voting with Haskell

## To get started
### Install Haskell
1. [MacOSX](https://www.haskell.org/platform/#osx)
2. [Linux](https://www.haskell.org/platform/#linux)
3. [Windows](https://www.haskell.org/platform/#windows)

### Run Script

``` shell
$ ./app/script.sh
```
**I do not know how to run a script in Windows sorry! I understand that [Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7.1) can run it.**

Then follow what it asks you 

## How it works

If you wish to build your own read [this pdf](./p1_c4020_i4035_192.pdf) provided
in the repo. You can implement it in any language!
